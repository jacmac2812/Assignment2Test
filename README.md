1) Reflections

1.1) Computer mouse
Responstime, quality regaarding to the plastic, and the materials. Load testing. If the mouse is wireless then how long the batterylife is. Connection between computer and mouse. Distance between the divice and mouse before disconnect. Drop test. How good the buttons are on the mouse.

1.2) Catasrophic failure
NASA launched a data-gathering unmanned space mission to fly past Venus. It did not go to plan.

The Mariner 1 space probe barely made it out of Cape Canaveral before the rocket veered dangerously off course. Worried that the rocket was heading towards a crash-landing on earth, NASA engineers issued a self-destruct command and the craft was obliterated about 290 seconds after launch.

An investigation revealed the cause to be a very simple software error. A hyphen was omitted in a line of code, which meant that incorrect guidance signals were sent to the spacecraft. The overall cost of the omission was reported to be more than $18 million at the time (about $169 million in todayâ€™s world).


3) Investigation of Tools
3.1 JUnit5 
Tag - Runs eevery test that have the same tag, and leave the other tests disabled
Disabled - The test will not run 
RepeatedTest - Run the same test multiple times 
BeforeEach, AfterEach - Runs before each test and runs after each test
BeforeAll, AfterAll - Runs before and after all tets
DisplayName - Create a custom name for the test
Nested - Gives the posibility to group mulitple test methods, inside into multiple nested test classed inside of a main outter test class. 
AssumeFalse, AssumeTrue - A set of methods useful for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful.

3.2) Mocking Frameworks
Mockito and easyMock 


What are their similarities? 
Both are open-source 
Both supports stubs


What are their differences?
easymock does not support spies, 



Which one would you prefer, if any, and why?
Mockito have less code and the posibility to support spies
